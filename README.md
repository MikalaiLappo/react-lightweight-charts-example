# React Lightweight Charts Example

This repository is a demonstration of how to use **Lightweight Charts v5** with **React**

_And **maybe** some demonstration of how to connect it to some CEX_

## Features Implemented

1. Connecting `lightweight-charts` instance reference to React state
2. Switch Between Candles and Bars series modes
3. Dynamic data update of the series from Binance

## Preview

It requiers to run a proxy to pass CORS for APIs, so the netlify page shouldn't be functioning at the moment

There is a wacky one in `proxyish.ts`, you may run it with `bun proxyish.ts`
